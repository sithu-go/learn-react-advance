KEY
U should add key when you loop

{todos.map((todo, index) => {
    <ToDo key={index} id={todo.id} createdAt={todo.createdAt} />
})}

// U should aware that when u reverse the components.\
setTodos([...todos].reverse())

index as key will cause you problem.
u should add id as key.

when the order of your list items is prone to change, index as key is a problem.

also don't use Math.random() as key. cause when the state change or ui loads, it will change the key too.
